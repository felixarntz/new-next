# new-next

CLI tool to scaffold opinionated Next.js projects with Bun + Ultracite.

## Architecture

- **Node-compatible:** No Bun-specific APIs in production code. Must work with both `npx` and `bunx`.
- **Build output:** `bun build` compiles `src/index.ts` → `dist/index.js` (single ESM bundle, Node target, `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang).
- **Global cwd via `process.chdir`:** The optional `[directory]` positional arg calls `process.chdir()` early, so all relative paths (in `exec`, `readTextFile`, `writeTextFile`) resolve against the target project directory without threading a path parameter.
- **Sequential steps:** Setup steps must run in order (foundation → shadcn → ai-sdk → ai-elements → cleanup) because later steps depend on files created by earlier ones.
- **AGENTS.md as source of truth:** `ultracite init` generates `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The foundation step moves it to `AGENTS.md` and symlinks `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`. All subsequent steps prepend their guidelines before the `# Ultracite Code Standards` header.

## Workflow Commands

Available scripts for this project, run via `bun`:

- `bun run build` — Create a production build
- `bun start` — Serve the production build
- `bun check` — Check code for linting and formatting issues
- `bun fix` — Auto-fix linting and formatting issues
- `bun typecheck` - Checks TypeScript types
- `bun run doctor` — Diagnose the Ultracite/Biome setup

Note: `build` and `doctor` need `bun run` since they conflict with built-in bun commands.

In general, default to using Bun instead of Node.js.

## Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

### Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

#### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

#### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

#### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

#### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

#### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

#### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

#### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

#### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

### Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

### When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `bun fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
